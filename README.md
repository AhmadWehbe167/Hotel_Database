# Hotel_Database
In this project I have learned to work with Database Management Systems using MySQL. 
We worked on this project in a team of 4 members. We developed an Hotel Database that
allows the management to track their employees and customers and hotel rooms and services
in general. It was awesome to start by ER Model and convert it to relational Model that
would be written in MySQl at last.  

Today, many duties revolve around organizing, accessing and manipulating data. The
most prominent and efficient way to manage data is by storing it in a database.

The ability to develop and maintain databases using a database management system is
becoming a critical skill that is required in almost all applications. I was introduced
to the fundamental concepts of databases, acquainted with database management
systems and trained to develop and maintain real-world database applications.
